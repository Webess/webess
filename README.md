### Hi, my name is Tom 👋

...and I currently work as a back-end developer for [Dajana Rodriguez 👜](https://dajanarodriguez.eu/), [Almalio 🛍️](https://almalio.com/), and [Bloom Robbins 💊](https://bloomrobbins.com/). Though I handle some front-end work occasionally, my primary focus is on back-end development.

- 🔭 I’m currently working from the [Dajana Rodriguez](https://dajanarodriguez.eu/) office 🏢 and from home 🏠
- ⚙️ I use daily: `laravel`, `october cms`, `vue`, `php`, `js`, `html`, `scss`, `shopify`
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my horizons of Shopify and React.
- 💭 I’m passionate about connecting the real world with technology.
- 📫 Reach me at tomas@liska.dev or on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomliska/)
- 🟫 Fun fact: I helped translate and proofread Minecraft into Slovak.
