### Hi, my name is Tom 👋

...and I'm working as a back-end developer for [Dajana Rodriguez 👜](https://dajanarodriguez.com/) and [ARTRA 🥾](https://artra.sk/en/). I'm also working on the front-end a bit, but it must already be designed 😅

- 🔭 I’m currently working from [Batovany Brands Studios](https://www.instagram.com/batovanybrandsstudios/)
- ⚙️ I use daily: `laravel`, `october cms`, `vue`, `php`, `js`, `html`, `scss`
- 🌱 I'm currently expanding my horizons in javascript
- 💭 I'm interested in connecting the real world and technology
- 📫 Reach me tomas@liska.dev or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomliska/)
- 🟫 Fun fact: I was translating Minecraft to Slovak
